# Linux-Migration-Assistant - First stages

We aim to bring some of the good stuff we've seen out there to facilitate migration from a computer to another! Or from a Distribution to an another!

# Planned Features

1. Backup your laptop on a USB Key or your HDD
2. Restore from a HDD or USB key ( Obviously!!! )
3. Restore your laptop from another laptop that is already running linux ( Thunderbolt/USB-C/USB )
4. Blockchain Machine Deployment 1-to-N & 1-to-1 ( We keep the best for last )

## Requirements

* Python 3.6 + (For the slow learners, sorry no python 2.7 will be ever planned)
* pydbus
* PackageKit

## Supported Distribution

* Ubuntu 18.04 +
* Fedora 30 +

We even plan to allow restore from Windows 10 to Linux!

For now we aim only the desktop and laptops but we might venture into the server world or maybe the cloud ... Why not!
